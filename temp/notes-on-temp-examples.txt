Notes by Hrothgar, updated Jan 2015.
----

To keep things straight, here is my understanding of the plan for each of the
examples living in the temp folder.


* BinousShaikhBellagi - Unfinished.

* CompactingColloids - Depends on the branch feature-pdes15s-noBCadjust,
    which seems to have disappeared. And I can't find any record of a
    pull request for it. We'll test it on master following the release.

* IntegroDiffT - Not sure.

* UnboundedODE - v5 doesn't (yet?) support ODEs on unbounded intervals.

* OptimCar - Not sure. Unfinished?

* PiecewiseLinopDemo - Not sure.

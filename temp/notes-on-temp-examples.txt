To keep things straight, here is my understanding of the plan for each of the
examples living in the temp folder.


* BinousShaikhBellagi - Unfinished.

* CompactingColloids - Depends on the branch feature-pdes15s-noBCadjust,
    which seems to have disappeared. And I can't find any record of a
    pull request for it. We'll test it on master following the release.

* IntegroDiffT - Not sure.

* UnboundedODE - v5 doesn't (yet?) support ODEs on unbounded intervals.

* OptimCar - Not sure. Unfinished?

* PiecewiseLinopDemo - Not sure.

* VdPOrbit.
  Several things are keeping this example from running as it did in V4.
    (1) Cannot do  diff(u,v)  for chebfuns u and v like before. We need
        to use  adchebfun/seed  to accomplish the same.
    (2) Applying an operatorBlock to an adchebfun does not return an
        adchebfun like it should.
    (3) Defining an operator as
            @(t,y)  diff(y)
        where y has multiple components appears not to be supported.
  Perhaps others.

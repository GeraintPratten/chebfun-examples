----
To keep things straight, here is my understanding of the plan for each of the
examples living in the temp folder.


1. EXAMPLES THAT WILL BECOME PUBLIC AT v5.1 RELEASE.

    * PeriodicSystem - Depends on `trig` stuff.

    * FourierCollocation - Depends on `trig` stuff.

    * FourierCollocationNonLin - Depends on `trig` stuff.

    * FourierEigs - Depends on `trig` stuff.

    * FourierExpm - Depends on `trig` stuff.

    * EigsViaDet - Fails on master due to the hscale bug.

    * Also, the example ode-nonlin/ModellingDiseases needs to be updated and
      republished to include mention of the new IVP capabilities (right now it
      says the feature is coming soon).


2. OTHER EXAMPLES IN TEMP.

    * BinousShaikhBellagi - Unfinished.

    * CompactingColloids - Depends on the branch feature-pdes15s-noBCadjust,
        which seems to have disappeared. And I can't find any record of a
        pull request for it. We'll test it on master following the release.

    * UnboundedODE - v5 doesn't (yet?) support ODEs on unbounded intervals.

    * OptimCar - Not sure. Unfinished?

    * PiecewiseLinopDemo - Not sure.
